# RIIR for cowsay!

Possible features:

1. Try to stick to std. Actually it's kinda hard to parse command line arguments) 
so maybe i need to figure out which tiny library i can add.
  
2. No external files (in origianl perl script cows are loaded from files)
3. Human readable cow format incorporated as constant string (in original cowsay
cows in files do not looks like when script printing it)
